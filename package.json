  "description": "For my project, I want to create a song visualizer that will visualize songs based on BPM/ highs/ lows, and “dance”/bounce with the music. I will allow users to upload their own music using .wav or .mp3 files to convert them into a string to play the music or users can select music from one of these APIs that I will try my best to implement: SoundCloud API, Youtube Audio Library API, and Jamendo API. Users will be able to use music controllers (play/pause, skip, previous, fastword, volume up and down) to control the music in various ways.",
